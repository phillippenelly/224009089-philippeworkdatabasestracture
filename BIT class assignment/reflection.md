Reflection Questions (Theoretical Discussion)
Stack Reflection:
Why is stack ideal for undo history but not queue tasks?

Stacks are perfect for undo functionality because they naturally implement the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle, which mirrors how users interact with applications. When users perform actions sequentially, they typically want to reverse them in reverse chronological order. The stack's push/pop operations directly correspond to action/undo patterns. However, stacks are unsuitable for queue tasks because they would process the most recent arrivals first, violating the fundamental fairness principle of "first come, first served" that's essential in service scenarios like customer service or ticket processing.

Queue Reflection:
Why FIFO prevents chaos in offices like RRA?

FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues prevent chaos in government offices like RRA by establishing an objective, transparent, and fair ordering system. This eliminates disputes over service order because:

Timestamp-based fairness: Service order is determined solely by arrival time

Predictable waiting: Citizens can estimate waiting times accurately

Dispute prevention: No subjective decisions about who gets served next

Social order: Maintains discipline and reduces conflicts in crowded settings

Efficiency: Streamlines processing by eliminating time spent resolving order disputes

The FIFO system creates a self-regulating environment where citizens naturally understand and respect the queue order, making administrative processes smoother and more efficient for both staff and the public.
