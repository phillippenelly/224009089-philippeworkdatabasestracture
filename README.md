1. Integers Section

So first, I created a list of player scores – just some numbers to represent how well each player performed. Then I calculated the total score by adding them all up, worked out the average by dividing the total by how many scores there were, and also found the lowest and highest scores using simple functions. After that, I printed all of these so I could see a quick summary of the team’s performance.

2. Strings Section

Next, I put together a short performance report using those score values. I used an f-string to insert the total and average scores into a message that explains the team’s overall performance in words. I made sure the average shows up with two decimal places to make it look clean and professional.

3. Booleans Section

Here, I wanted to check if the team is doing well or not. I set a threshold score of 15 and used a condition to check if the average score is above that and if the highest score is above 20. If both are true, I print “Above Standard.” If not, it prints “Below Standard.” It’s just a simple way to judge overall performance based on numbers.

4. Lists Section

Now I started managing the actual player names. I made a list of team players, then added a new player named Eva to it. After that, I looked through the list and removed any player whose name starts with 'B' – which in this case was Bob. Once Bob was removed, I sorted the list alphabetically and printed it at each step to show how the team list changed.

5. Arrays Section

In this part, I tried out Python’s array module. I converted the player scores into an array, which is kind of like a list but more efficient for handling numbers. I calculated the total of the array and compared it with the total from the original list to see if they match – and they did. This shows arrays can be just as reliable as lists for numeric operations.

6. Dictionaries Section

Finally, I created a list of dictionaries to represent each player’s full data – including their ID, name, and score (which I called "value"). I updated Bob’s score from 18 to 20, then removed Charlie from the list. After that, I added up the remaining values to get the new total score and printed the updated records. This part shows how I can work with more structured data when needed.
